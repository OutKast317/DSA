# 📚 Data Structures in Java

This repository contains implementations of various **Linear** and **Non-linear Data Structures** in Java, organized for clarity and progressive learning.

---

### ✅ Linear Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)

### 🌲 Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables

## 👨‍💻 Who Is This For?

- 🎓 **Computer Science students** who want to grasp core concepts.
- 👩‍💻 **Entry-level developers** preparing for coding interviews.
- 📖 Anyone who wants to understand both the abstract and low-level workings of data structures.

## 🔖 Structure

Each data structure is categorized by two main types:

### 1. Using Built-in Java Functions
- Focused on leveraging Java’s standard library (`java.util`) for quick and effective development.
- Great for understanding how Java Collections work (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`, `Queue`, `HashMap`, etc.)

### 2. Manual Implementation (From Scratch)
- Designed for students and entry-level developers to **build deep understanding** of how data structures work internally.
- Implemented using **custom Node classes**, pointer manipulation, and memory structure awareness.
- Similar to how data structures are implemented in C/C++.
